# Winequality_PCA

- Data1: Here we will take the data which follows normal distribution

- Data2: Based on above data we will create a another data by multiplying some value

- so that both data sets have multicollinearity

- The both datasets have some covariance

- Then we will apply PCA

- Will create two new PCs, will check the Covariance matrix again

- So the PCs covariance should be zero
